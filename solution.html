                <li>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</li>
                <li>Thou art more lovely and more temprate:</li>
                <li>Rough winds to shake the darling buds of May,</li>
                <li>And summer's lease hath all too short a cast:</li>
                <li>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</li>
                <li>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,</li>
                <li>And every fair from fair sometimes declines,</li>
                <li>By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd</li>
                <li>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</li>
                <li>Nor lose posession of that fair thou ow'st,</li>
                <li>Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade</li>
                <li>When in eternal lines to time though grow'st</li>
                <li>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,</li>
                <li>So long lives this, and give life to thee</li>
             </ul>
